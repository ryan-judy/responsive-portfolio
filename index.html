          Hello! My name is Ryan Judy. I'm a digital marketer finding the intersection of design, writing,  inbound marketing, and web development. I'm currently employed as a Marketing Director for a <a href="http://www.youngteamrealtors.com">Cleveland-based real estate company</a> and taking classes in coding.
          </p>
          <p>
          I graduated Ohio University in 2014 with a degree in Journalism, specializing in strategic communication. For the past three years I've worked in real estate marketing mainly writing, design, imaging, lead generation, print + digital advertising, to making a brief stint on HGTV (it was .5 seconds, but that still counts, right?). I've grown to absolutely love architecture and home design. I've been in over 150 houses from all over Cleveland, from $30,000 houses to 3 million dollar homes, and I'm always intrigued by what any home has to offer.
          </p>
          <p>
          I'm a native east-sider, but recently just moved to the west side. I love exploring everything Cleveland has to offer- from restaurants, hiking, arts, to getting involved in the community. In my free time, I like to hang out with my cat Kitten Tarantino, eat delicious food, drink good beer, and enjoy music/movies/tv.
          </p>
